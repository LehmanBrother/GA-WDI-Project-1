# Project 1:
## Magic: The Gathering

### Overview
In Magic: The Gathering (original game by Wizards of the Coast), two opposing wizards known as Planeswalkers attempt to reduce each other's life totals to 0. This is achieved by using mana, a magical resource produced by lands, to cast spells and summon creatures to attack the opponent.

In this version of the game, the spells to which players have access will be limited to vanilla (i.e. without any special abilities) creatures. Both lands and creatures are represented by cards drawn from a library and held in the player's hand. Two players will be able to do the following:
-Play lands from their hands
-Tap these lands to create mana
-Spend mana to cast creature spells
-Use these creatures to attack their opponent
-Use their creatures to block their opponent's attacks
-Deal each other damage and destroy each other's creatures in the process of combat
-Progress through the phases and turns of the game until one player's life total is reduced to 0 or lower.
